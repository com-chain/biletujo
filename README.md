## Our Philosophy

- Empower the people: Give people the ability to interact with the
  Ethereum blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.

- Make it easy & free: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and
  send Tokens without additional cost.  People are the Priority: People
  are the most important.

- If it can be hacked, it will be hacked: Never save, store, or
  transmit secret info, like passwords or keys. Open source &
  auditable.
