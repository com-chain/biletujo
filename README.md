Our Philosophy

    Empower the people: Give people the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.

    People are the Priority: People are the most important.
    If it can be hacked, it will be hacked: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
    Open source & auditable
